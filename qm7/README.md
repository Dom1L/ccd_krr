# QM7 Dataset

This dataset is a subset of GDB-13 (a database of nearly 1 billion stable and synthetically accessible organic molecules) composed of all molecules of up to 23 atoms (including 7 heavy atoms C, N, O, and S), totalling 7165 molecules.
It contains atomization energies and relaxed geometries at PBE0/def2-TZVP level of theory for ~7k GDB1-7 molecules, [Ruddigkeit et al, J Chem Inf Model, 2012](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ci300415d), 
[Rupp et al, Phys Rev Letters, 2012](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.108.058301).


# Data Source
